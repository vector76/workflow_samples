Transform the implementation plan you just read into a structured list of beads.

Create a markdown file named `bead_list.md` containing:
- A list of all beads to be created
- For each bead, specify what work is included
- For each bead, specify its dependencies (using placeholder names initially)
- The list should be specific enough to capture scope and dependencies, but doesn't
  need full detail since the implementation plan will be available during bead creation

The format should be a simple markdown list that will later be updated with actual
bead identifiers (like bd-xk2a3) as they are created.
