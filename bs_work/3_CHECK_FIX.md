Good! Now look again, reviewing the work so far and look for mistakes or 
errors or any places where there is a better way.  There's not necessarily 
anything wrong.  Just check.

When complete, respond with <goto>4_NO_FIX.md</goto> (which checks for what to 
do next).  Do NOT try to goto any other state.
